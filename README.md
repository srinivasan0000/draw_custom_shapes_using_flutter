# draw_custom_shapes_using_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


I've been experimenting with Flutter's CustomPainter recently, 
to get more familiar with it. Check out this sample app where I've tried different shapes using Flutter CustomPaint.
It's a great way to get comfortable with custom shapes.
